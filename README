ViewWorld reporting
===================

The ViewWorld app ensures speedy, credible, and efficient communication and reporting from activities in the world's poorest countries â€“ and from all over the world.

Collect information - text, data, photos, video, sound and GPS coordinates - and make it available with a single click on your website, in reports, statistics and graphs.

Define questions and forms and see, edit, download, and analyze data at www.viewworld.dk. A login is required to upload data to the viewworld.dk server and to see uploaded data.

The technology has been developed. Through this innovative application we will help people from poor countries use it and benefit from it.
